## 👋  Hola!
I'm Fernanda Luna (She/Her/Hers) and I'm a Software Engineer at Wizeline👩🏻‍💻. 

#### 🌸  About me
- Most of my repos are personal projects. The code is messy and it can also be a bit ugly.
- I'm focused on frontend development. I don't like backend-only roles, because I'm not good at backend and it also bores me :(.
- I love traveling, reading, drawing and learning new languages.
