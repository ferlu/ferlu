## ðŸ‘‹  Hola!
I'm Fernanda Luna, and I'm a Frontend Developer from MX :) 

#### ðŸŒ¸  About me
- Strengths: I'm a team player, I'm funny. I'm proactive. I would make a good leader. I'm empathetic. I love coding. I get stuff done. What I don't know, I can learn (I really mean this). I can communicate my needs and doubts. I can help others and I enjoy it. Big attention to detail. I can recommend good keyboards and cool apps. 
- Weaknesses: I don't have any. Just kidding! I'm not the greatest at algorithms, I tend to procrastinate and I can be quite stubborn sometimes. I get distracted easily. I don't love sharing food (sorry). I might love WFH too much. 
- Hobbies: I love traveling, reading, drawing and learning new languages.
